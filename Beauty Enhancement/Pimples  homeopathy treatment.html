                    <h3 class="text-body mb-4">what is Pimples? </h3>
                    <p class="mb-4 fs-6">Pimples aren't just caused by things like oil and bacteriaâ€”they can also pop up
                        because of daily habits like what we eat, how we sleep, and how stressed we are. Hormonal
                        changes, especially during big life events like puberty or pregnancy, can also cause our skin to
                        get oilier, leading to more pimples.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4 fs-6">Taking care of pimples means doing things like washing our face regularly with
                        gentle products, avoiding rough treatments, and not touching our face too much to keep bacteria
                        away. Homeopathy looks at everything that might be causing pimples, like our skin type,
                        hormones, and overall health, to give us treatments that are just right for us. These treatments
                        help calm down redness, keep oil in check, and support our skin's natural health, so we can say
                        bye-bye to pimples the natural way!

                    <p class="mb-4 fs-6">Holistic Care: Homeopathy looks at your unique skin type, hormonal changes, and
                        even your daily habits to figure out why you're getting pimples. This personalized approach
                        means you get treatments that suit you best.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4 fs-6">Gentle Ingredients: Homeopathic medicines are made from natural stuff that's
                        super gentle on your skin. That means no harsh chemicals and fewer chances of side effects,
                        giving your skin the TLC it needs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4 fs-6">Healing from Within: Instead of just dealing with the pimples on the surface,
                        homeopathy dives deep to tackle the reasons behind them. By balancing things internally, it
                        helps your skin stay healthy in the long run.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4 fs-6">Lasting Solutions: Homeopathy isn't about quick fixes. It's all about making
                        sure those pesky pimples don't keep coming back. By improving your overall skin health, you're
                        less likely to deal with future breakouts.
